# Movie Rating System
This project is a movie rating system implemented in Java using the Swing framework and a database developed using XAMPP. The system allows users to view a list of movies, add new movies, and rate existing movies. The movies and their ratings are stored in a database, which can be accessed and modified through the user interface.
